## Background
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Baltimore is the largest city in the state of Maryland with the largest city payroll. Maryland is a fairly prosperous state with several important industries including services to the federal sector since Washington, DC, is literally next door. Also, Maryland is prominent in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Again, proximity to federal enities is a driver to this with NIH, NIST and other sources of federal money nearby. Baltimore hosts Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which in turn has brought a lot of insurance related jobs to Maryland and Baltimore particularly.
